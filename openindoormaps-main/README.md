**OpenIndoorMaps** is an open-source project focused on providing a minimalist, self-hostable indoor navigation solution. The goal is to help users navigate complex indoor spaces such as shopping malls, airports, hospitals, and universities, using web-based mapping technologies.

## Release Status

**Current Version: Pre-Alpha (Map Viewer Demo Only)**

This release is an **early** development version featuring **only a demo** of the map viewer. It allows you to explore the basic indoor navigation functionality. Please note that this demo is limited in scope and is subject to breaking changes as development continues.

### What's Next?

We are actively working on expanding the project. The next major steps include:

- **Map Editor:** A user-friendly tool to create and edit indoor maps.
- **Backend Integration:** A robust backend to handle indoor map data management and additional features.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates, and feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or report issues.

## Why OpenIndoorMaps?

Many current indoor navigation solutions lack the flexibility and adaptability needed for diverse environments. Often, they are limited in functionality, difficult to customize, or locked behind proprietary systems that restrict user control. Smaller projects, while free, frequently lack the support, scalability, or customization options needed for real-world applications.

**OpenIndoorMaps** addresses these challenges by:

- Being **self-hostable**: Full control over your deployment, data, and customization.
- **Open-Source Values**: Focus on transparency, accessibility, and community support.
- Being built on **OpenStreetMap**: Leverages a trusted, community-driven, and open-source platform.
- Offering a **customizable** and **minimalist** solution: Tailor the map and navigation experience to your venueâ€™s specific needs without unnecessary complexity or overhead. We aim to create a reliable, flexible, and open alternative to both commercial and limited indoor mapping solutions.

## Key Features

- **Indoor Navigation**: Provides detailed maps to guide users through large indoor spaces.
- **Customizable Admin Panel**: Manage and customize maps, routes, and app settings.
- **Multi-Floor Support**: Seamless navigation across different floors.
- **API Integration**: Open APIs for integrating third-party services and tools.

### What Itâ€™s **Not**:

- **Indoor positioning using wireless technologies** like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is not planned due to current browser limitations. Instead, we focus on more accessible solutions such as QR codes for position identification.
- **Native mobile apps**: At this stage, **OpenIndoorMaps** will be web-based. Given the lower current demand for indoor maps, a mobile app is not a priority. However, as use cases grow and evolve, this may be reconsidered in the future.

## Use Cases

**OpenIndoorMaps** can be applied in various industries:

- **Shopping Malls**: Guide customers through multiple floors and promote store offers.
- **Hospitals**: Help patients and visitors find their way through complex layouts.
- **Museums**: Provide interactive tours and detailed information on exhibits.
- **Trade Shows**: Enable visitors to find booths and gather heatmap data for event optimization.
- **Universities**: Assist students in navigating campuses and locating classrooms.
- **Airports**: Navigate gates, baggage claims, and facilities.
- **Libraries**: Help users find books, study rooms, and resources.
- **Parking Garages**: Direct drivers to available spaces and exits.
